# Gabriel Fernandez’s Portfolio

## About Me
I am a **Research Associate and Data Analyst** with 4+ years of experience in mixed-methods research, behavioral analytics, and insight generation across clinical, academic, and applied settings. My background spans experimental design, data analysis, and evidence-based evaluation, using both quantitative tools (Python, SQL, SPSS) and qualitative methods (surveys, structured feedback, usability studies).

This portfolio highlights my work in data analysis, visualization, research workflows, and statistical modeling, demonstrating how I combine research rigor with technical skills to answer meaningful questions across UX, clinical, and data-focused environments.

## Data Science Projects

### Correlation Matrix Heatmaps
Explores relationships between pain-related psychophysical variables before and after an educational intervention to assess the intervention's impact.

**Key Contributions**:
- Performed Spearman rank-order correlations to identify significant relationships.
- Generated correlation heatmaps annotated with significance markers.
- Utilized vectorized operations for efficient computations.

**View Project**:  
- [Separate Images Version](https://github.com/gf404/Portfolio/blob/main/separate_corr_matrices_pain_ed.py)  
- [Combined Images Version](https://github.com/gf404/Portfolio/blob/main/combined_corr_matrix_heatmap.py)

### Baseline vs. Post-Education Analysis with Bar Graphs
Analyzes changes in pain management metrics after an educational intervention, visualizing the results through bar charts with statistical annotations.

**Key Contributions**:
- Applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare baseline and post-intervention measurements.
- Created a grouped bar chart with standard deviation error bars and significance indicators.
