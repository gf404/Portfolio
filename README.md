Gabriel Fernandez’s Data Science Portfolio

About Me
I am a Research Associate currently expanding my skill set to transition into a Data Scientist role. My background in research has equipped me with a strong foundation in critical thinking, 
experimental design, and data interpretation. Building on these experiences, I’ve developed a portfolio of projects showcasing my capabilities in data analysis, visualization, 
and statistical modeling using Python, SQL, and various data science tools.I’m passionate about applying data-driven insights to solve real-world problems, enhance decision-making, 
and uncover meaningful patterns in complex datasets.

Skills and Tools
Programming Languages: Python, SQL
Data Manipulation & Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Statistical Methods: Correlation analysis, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman’s rank correlation
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning (in progress): Scikit-learn
Workflow & Environment: Google Colab, Git, GitHub

Projects
1. Correlation Matrix Heatmaps
Description: Explores relationships between pain-related psychophysical variables before and after an educational intervention.
Key Contributions:
Performed Spearman rank-order correlations to identify significant relationships.
Generated correlation heatmaps annotated with significance markers.
Utilized vectorized operations for efficient computations.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

2. Baseline vs. Post-Education Analysis with Bar Graphs
Description: Analyzes changes in pain management metrics after an educational intervention, visualizing the results through bar charts with statistical annotations.
Key Contributions:
Applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare baseline and post-intervention measurements.
Created a grouped bar chart with standard deviation error bars and significance indicators.
Emphasized clear variable labeling and interpretability for non-technical audiences.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

3. Data Summaries and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Description: Offers a structured overview of a dataset, including summary statistics, distribution plots, and initial correlations.
Key Contributions:
Computed summary statistics and identified preliminary trends.
Visualized variable distributions to guide further analysis.
Established a reproducible EDA workflow suitable for initial data assessments.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
