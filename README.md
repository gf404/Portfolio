# Gabriel Fernandez’s Portfolio

## About Me
I am a **Research Associate** actively expanding my technical skill set to transition into a full-time **Data Scientist** role. My background in research has equipped me with a strong foundation in critical thinking, experimental design, and data interpretation. Building on these experiences, I’ve developed a portfolio of projects showcasing my capabilities in data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling using Python, SQL, and various data science tools.

## Data Science Projects

### Correlation Matrix Heatmaps
Explores relationships between pain-related psychophysical variables before and after an educational intervention to assess the intervention's impact.

**Key Contributions**:
- Performed Spearman rank-order correlations to identify significant relationships.
- Generated correlation heatmaps annotated with significance markers.
- Utilized vectorized operations for efficient computations.

**View Project**:  
- [Separate Images Version](https://github.com/gf404/Portfolio/blob/main/separate_corr_matrices_pain_ed.py)  
- [Combined Images Version](https://github.com/gf404/Portfolio/blob/main/combined_corr_matrix_heatmap.py)

### Baseline vs. Post-Education Analysis with Bar Graphs
Analyzes changes in pain management metrics after an educational intervention, visualizing the results through bar charts with statistical annotations.

**Key Contributions**:
- Applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare baseline and post-intervention measurements.
- Created a grouped bar chart with standard deviation error bars and significance indicators.

### Data Summaries and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Provides an overview of the dataset, including summary statistics, distribution plots, and initial correlations.

**Key Contributions**:
- Computed summary statistics and visualized distributions (histograms, boxplots).
- Established a reproducible EDA workflow for initial assessments.
