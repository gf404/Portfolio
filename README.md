## Data Science Projects

### Correlation Matrix Heatmaps
Explores relationships between pain-related psychophysical variables before and after an educational intervention to assess the intervention's impact.

**Key Contributions**:
- Performed Spearman rank-order correlations to identify significant relationships.
- Generated correlation heatmaps annotated with significance markers.
- Utilized vectorized operations for efficient computations.

### Baseline vs. Post-Education Analysis with Bar Graphs
Analyzes changes in pain management metrics after an educational intervention, visualizing the results through bar charts with statistical annotations.

**Key Contributions**:
- Applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare baseline and post-intervention measurements.
- Created a grouped bar chart with standard deviation error bars and significance indicators.
